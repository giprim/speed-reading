This app is a speed-reading tool built with Vue and TailwindCSS.
It takes any text input and projects the words one after another on the screen. Users can:
-	Set display preferences – background color, text color, font size, content, and duration.
-	Control speed – adjust how fast words appear, with automatic calculation of words per minute (WPM).
-	Choose word grouping – display 1 or more words at once using numberOfWordsOnDisplay.
-	Playback controls – start with a 3-second countdown, then play, pause/resume, or stop the session at any time.

The goal is to help readers practice faster reading and improve focus by controlling the pace and presentation of words.
